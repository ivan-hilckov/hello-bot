# Working with Claude on Hello Bot

Guide for effective collaboration with Claude AI assistant on Hello Bot development.

## Quick Start

Claude understands the Hello Bot project architecture and follows specific development patterns. Here's how to get the best results:

### üéØ Effective Prompts

**‚úÖ Good prompts:**

```
"Add a /help command that lists all available commands"
"Fix the database connection pool for production deployment"
"Implement user analytics with async patterns"
"Review the security of user data handling"
```

**‚ùå Avoid:**

```
"Make the bot better"
"Fix everything"
"Add features"
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Understanding

Claude knows about:

- **Dual Mode**: Development (polling) vs Production (webhook)
- **aiogram 3.0+**: Modern Router patterns, dependency injection, advanced filters
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation with UserService, BaseService
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0**: Async patterns, concurrency safety, optimized indexes
- **Redis Caching**: Multi-layer caching with memory fallback
- **2GB VPS Optimization**: Memory limits, connection pooling, resource monitoring
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions, 4-5 minute deployment, Docker caching
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 12 comprehensive tests with pytest
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, enhanced health checks

### üìã Code Standards
